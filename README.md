## Bugs
- [ ] `new Date().toISOString()` shows the wrong UK time zone - 1 hour behind 
- [x] createPost and deletePost not working - Solved: add userID parameter
- [x] empty posts can be created - Solved: add missing validation
- [x] unable to connect to Apollo Client - Solved: CORS Policy
- [x] likeCount and commentCount not showing - Solved: incorrect fetching query call 
- [x] typeDef errors - Solved: not correctly using ID! or String! 
- [x] Shows blank page if user is not logged in - Temp Solved: Protect all routes so users must be logged in 
- [x] Netlify build failing if eslint errors found - Solved: add environment variables CI=False
- [x] Links which open to another page in app doesn't open from top of new page - Solved: [Scroll Restoration](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/scroll-restoration) 
- [x] .env variable not read in api - Solved: install dotenv dependency
- [x] posting comment on a post will return comment by OP's instead of current user - Solved: use logged in userId instead of user on postId
- [x] likeButton ternary not functioning properly (if liking other user's posts, button doesn't change color) - Solved: use logged in userId instead of user on postId
- [ ] Check if actual bug -> on like, it sets state of setLiked to false
