# Process 
1. Plan! Come up with an idea on paper, create a wireframe with MoqUps 
2. Set up server, database, and install necessary dependencies 
3. Create react front-end using `create-react-app` 
4. Create models for Posts and Users and resolvers for graphQL 
5. Connect front end to back end and connect mongoDB database to AuthO 

## Changelog

### react-client
1. Set up file structure for react-client with compnents, layout and views 
2. Install and add config for Auth0 - signup/login/logout routes and protected route 
3. Install and add config for @apollo/client dependencies - wrap ApolloProvider around App 
4. Add basic styling to layout components
5. Create three responsive columns using grid and flex for sidebar, feed and right sidebar 
6. Fetch data from apollo-client using graphQL, map, and render in Posts component  
7. WIP: Authed users can see and use CreatePost component to make a new post

### api
1. Set up apollo-server w/ express.js and config for graphQL 
2. Create cluster and database on MongoDB and connect to server 
3. Design initial schema for Post and User 
4. Add CRUD functions for creating a new user and creating / deleting posts 
5. Add create and delete for comments on Posts and likes on Posts
